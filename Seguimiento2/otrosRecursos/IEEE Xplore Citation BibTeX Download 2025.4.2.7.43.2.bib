  abstract={At present, the development of artificial intelligence technology has entered a new bottleneck period, and the algorithm dividend based on statistics has been exhausted. In the future, we should pay more attention to improving the efficient, intelligent collaboration among humans, machines, and the environment. This review first discusses the bottleneck problems encountered in the current artificial intelligence technology, then analyzes the essence of human intelligence and the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the current machine intelligence and human intelligence. Based on this, it puts forward that the enhancement point of artificial intelligence technology is to enhance the efficient cooperation of the human-computer environment and states our solution, namely the deep situation awareness method based on human-computer integration technology. In the end, we put forward some thoughts about intelligence.},
