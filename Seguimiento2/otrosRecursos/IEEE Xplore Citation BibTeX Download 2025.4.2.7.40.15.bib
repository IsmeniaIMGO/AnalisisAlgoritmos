  abstract={Representation learning is the base and crucial for consequential tasks, such as classification, regression, and recognition. The goal of representation learning is to automatically learning good features with deep models. Multimodal representation learning is a special representation learning, which automatically learns good features from multiple modalities, and these modalities are not independent, there are correlations and associations among modalities. Furthermore, multimodal data are usually heterogeneous. Due to the characteristics, multimodal representation learning poses many difficulties: how to combine multimodal data from heterogeneous sources; how to jointly learning features from multimodal data; how to effectively describe the correlations and associations, etc. These difficulties triggered great interest of researchers along with the upsurge of deep learning, many deep multimodal learning methods have been proposed by different researchers. In this paper, we present an overview of deep multimodal learning, especially the approaches proposed within the last decades. We provide potential readers with advances, trends and challenges, which can be very helpful to researchers in the field of machine, especially for the ones engaging in the study of multimodal deep machine learning.},
