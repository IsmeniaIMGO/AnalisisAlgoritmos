  abstract={With the in-depth development of intelligent technology, game artificial intelligence (AI) has become the technical core of improving the playability of a game and the main selling point of game promotion, deepening the game experience realm. Modern computer games achieve the realism of games by integrating graphics, physics and artificial intelligence. It is difficult to define the meaning of realistic game experience, but generally speaking, it usually refers to the immersion of the game and the intelligence of non-player characters in the game. As the technical core of improving game playability and the selling point of many commercial games, game artificial intelligence gives players a way to interact with non-player characters in the game, and promotes the realm of game experience to a higher level. Based on this, this paper analyzes the history and present situation of artificial intelligence in game development, and puts forward the possible changes and impacts of artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning on game development in the future.},
