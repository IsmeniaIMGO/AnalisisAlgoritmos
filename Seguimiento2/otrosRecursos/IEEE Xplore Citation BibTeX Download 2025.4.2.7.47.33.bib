  abstract={Cloud computing is the development of parallel computing, distributed computing and grid computing. It has been one of the most hot research topics. Now many corporations have involved in the cloud computing related techniques and many cloud computing platforms have been put forward. This is a favorable situation to study and application of cloud computing related techniques. Though interesting, there are also some problems for so many flatforms. For to a novice or user with little knowledge about cloud computing, it is still very hard to make a reasonable choice. What differences are there for different cloud computing platforms and what characteristics and advantages each has? To answer these problems, the characteristics, architectures and applications of several popular cloud computing platforms are analyzed and discussed in detail. From the comparison of these platforms, users can better understand the different cloud platforms and more reasonablely choose what they want.},
