  abstract={The Software Engineer is a key member of the software development team. This paper explores the skills needed by a Software Engineer, and discusses how people are educated to acquire these skills. Based on recommendations from international organisations, the paper argues that Software Engineering is a professional engineering qualification. The relationship between engineering accreditation and the educational outcomes of a Software Engineering curriculum is discussed. Compared to other engineering disciplines, Software Engineering is very new. There is very little practical experience anywhere in the world of how Software Engineers should be educated. Many South African Universities are beginning to introduce computer-related engineering programmes. In the paper a case study of Software Engineering education is presented, focussing on South Africa. The difficulties associated with structuring and delivering these programmes in South Africa are described, and ideas are put forward for dealing with these difficulties.},
