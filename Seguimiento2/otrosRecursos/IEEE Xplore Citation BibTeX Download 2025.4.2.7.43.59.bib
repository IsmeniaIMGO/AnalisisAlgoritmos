  abstract={The application of artificial intelligence in education has greatly affected school management, teachers' teaching and students' learning, and has an important influence on the mechanism and mechanism of learning process. The concept of artificial intelligence is to simulate human intelligence by machine, thus completing specific roles and tasks, and has the characteristics of convenience, intelligence and interaction. It is mainly applied to computer vision, natural language processing, biometric recognition, speech recognition, human-computer interaction and other technologies in the field of education, which brings space for the development of architecture, medicine and chemistry. However, AI also brings about the risk of decisionmaking mistakes, career substitution, privacy leakage, information cocoon house and data bias. In order to avoid these risks effectively, this paper puts forward solutions from five perspectives: the state, product developers, educational managers, teachers and students, so as to correctly understand the relationship between artificial intelligence and education, explore the application mode of artificial intelligence in the field of education, and ensure the deep integration of artificial intelligence and education.},
