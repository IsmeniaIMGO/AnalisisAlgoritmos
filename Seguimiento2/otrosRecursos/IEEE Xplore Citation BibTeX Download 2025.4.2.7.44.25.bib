  abstract={Artificial intelligence is one of the most trending topics in the field of Computer Science which aims to make machines and computers ‘smart’. There are multiple diverse technical and specialized research associated with it. Due to the accelerating rate of technological changes, artificial intelligence has taken over a lot of human jobs and is giving excellent results that are more efficient and effective, than humans. However, a lot of time there has been a concern about the following: will artificial intelligence surpass human intelligence in the near future? Are computers' ever accelerating abilities to outpace human jobs and skills a matter of concern? The different views and myths on the subject have made it even a more than just a topic of discussion. In this research paper, we will study the existing facts and literature to understand the true definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence (HI) by classifying each of its types separately and analyzing the extent of their full capabilities. Later, we will discuss the possibilities if AI eventually can replace human jobs in the market. Finally, we will synthesize and summarize results and findings of why artificial intelligence cannot surpass human intelligence completely in the future.},
