  abstract={Thanks to new technologies, internet, connected objects we produce a phenomenal amount of data. Putting these data in context, organizing them to be able to perceive, understand and reflect them is very important. Traditionally, human have analyzed data. However, as the volume of data surpasses, human increasingly turn to automated systems that can imitate him. Those systems able to learn from both data and changes in data in order to solve problems are called machine learning. Artificial intelligence has a major impact on e-learning research and the machine learning based methods can be implemented to improve Technology Enhanced Learning Environments (TELE). This paper is an overview of the recent findings in this research field. At first, we introduce the key concepts related to machine learning. Then, we present some recent works using machine learning in e-learning context.},
