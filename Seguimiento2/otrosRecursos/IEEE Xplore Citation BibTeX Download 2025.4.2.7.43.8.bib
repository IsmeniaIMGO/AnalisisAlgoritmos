  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into diabetes care holds the potential to transform patient management and improve outcomes, especially in Malaysia, where diabetes represents a major public health challenge. However, the adoption and effectiveness of AI in healthcare are significantly impacted by patient attitudes. This paper addresses the gap in understanding these attitudes. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the perspectives of diabetic patients on the use of AI applications and tools in diabetes care. This study also examined the patterns of acceptance and understanding of AI among diabetic patients. This study used qualitative methods using in-depth interviews with seventeen Malaysian diabetic patients in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Klang (HTAR), Malaysia. The interview lasted two weeks, from August 8, 2023, to August 22, 2023. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed word-for-word. The transcribed content was then organized and coded using ATLAS.ti version 8. Thematic analysis was performed in accordance with established guidelines for data analysis. Three key themes emerged from participant interviews regarding the patients' attitudes toward AI application in diabetes care. These themes were perceived acceptability, perceived benefits of using AI tools, and perceived need. The majority of participants expressed their positive view of using AI tools. The findings of this study lay the groundwork for a theoretical framework aimed at understanding patients' stances on AI applications in diabetic care, emphasizing the health, technological, and social experiences that influence their perspectives on AI in this context.},
