  abstract={The emerging paradigm of cloud computing (CC) arises security risks that adversely impact its different stakeholders. The widespread deployment and service models of CC in addition to the wide variety of stakeholders make it difficult to guarantee privacy and security. This work-in-progress paper proposes a stakeholder-oriented taxonomical approach that determines the security and privacy issues for various CC models from a stakeholder's perspective. It recommends a comprehensive list of security and privacy attributes that are related to these issues. The goal is to provide stakeholders with the security issues associated with their interaction with the cloud. This will assist every stakeholder of a CC model in identifying the security and privacy concerns that are pertinent to them, based on the service and deployment model they use. This will help promote security and privacy among the stakeholders and refute their fears from utilizing this emerging technology.},
