  abstract={Edge network topology optimization is an innovative structural design method that has made significant breakthroughs in the fields of aerospace and engineering. The use of data-driven network topology optimization has become the direction and trend of future structured topology research. At present, machine learning is fast, with greatly improved efficiency and accuracy; Machine learning can effectively solve the time-consuming problem of traditional implicit topology; And the prediction result of machine learning algorithm can be used as the Initial condition for optimizing the movable deformation component, so as to achieve the effect of rapid convergence. Network structure topology optimization can be widely applied in the field of science and technology, deepening scientific research, and promoting the continuous development of scientific productivity.},
