  abstract={With the development of science and technology, computer technology is more and more widely used in people's life. As a branch of computer technology, artificial intelligence technology is also gradually developing and expanding, affecting people's life. Nowadays, the processing ability shown by simple computer technology has gradually lagged behind the times. If you want more convenient data processing, artificial intelligence is an excellent solution. Agent technology in artificial intelligence makes artificial intelligence have stronger data processing ability and learning ability than computer technology, and can make decisions quickly according to data information. Artificial intelligence technology can promote automation and intelligence in various industries and improve the production efficiency of enterprises. Starting from the elaboration of artificial intelligence, this paper deeply explores the relationship between artificial intelligence and computer, analyzes the development status of artificial intelligence and computer, and puts forward the technical problems between artificial intelligence and computer, so as to provide reference for the further development of artificial intelligence.},
