  abstract={The in-depth development and widespread application of artificial intelligence technology will have significant impact on electricity demand. However, there are few comprehensive analyses. This article will analyze the direct and indirect impact respectively. For direct impact, artificial intelligence requires various data centers to provide huge computing and storage capabilities, which will increase the electricity demand of data centers; for indirect impact, artificial intelligence will also optimize the time and space distribution of electricity demand and deepen energy conservation and power saving in the whole society. Research shows that the development of artificial intelligence will increase the electricity consumption of data centers, and it is necessary to plan ahead for the infrastructure related to the electricity consumption of artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence plays an important role in promoting the development of demand response, and a largescale joint dispatch mechanism of electricity and computing power for the power market should be explored; data centers have a large space for energy conservation and carbon reduction, and a sound electricity price mechanism that comprehensively considers green electricity consumption and energy efficiency should be established to promote data centers to widely participate in green electricity transactions and actively reduce their own PUE.},
