  abstract={The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedical imaging heralds a transformative era in medical diagnostics and research. This comprehensive overview explores the multifaceted impact of AI on various imaging modalities, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize disease detection, characterization, and treatment planning. AI applications, particularly machine learning and deep learning, enhance the analysis of intricate imaging data, providing quicker and more accurate insights. This review delves into AI's role in automating diagnosis through the development of sophisticated algorithms, enabling faster and more precise identification of diseases across diverse medical imaging platforms. Furthermore, AI contributes to improving image quality, facilitating early detection of abnormalities, and enhancing decision support systems for clinicians. Beyond diagnosis, AI facilitates personalized medicine by tailoring treatment strategies based on individual patient data extracted from imaging. The ethical considerations and privacy implications of handling sensitive medical information are also discussed, ensuring a balanced perspective on the adoption of AI in healthcare. As AI continues to advance, this overview concludes with insights into future trends, challenges, and the collaborative synergy between technology, healthcare practitioners, and researchers, underscoring the ongoing evolution of biomedical imaging through artificial intelligence.},
