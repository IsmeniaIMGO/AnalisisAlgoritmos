  abstract={The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies holds significant promise for enhancing human-centric applications, particularly in the domain of law enforcement. This paper explores the application of AI and ML in crime prevention and resource allocation, pivotal areas of concern for law enforcement agencies (LEAs) globally. By utilizing historical crime data, sensory inputs, and advanced analytics, this study contributes to the evolving discourse on smart policing and proactive crime strategies. Our objective is to facilitate the transformation of LEAs from primarily reactive entities into proactive crime preventers through the adoption of predictive analytics, facial recognition enhanced surveillance, and natural language processing for efficient data analysis. We emphasize that collaborative efforts with AI experts ensure the responsible use of technology, meticulously balancing security imperatives with privacy concerns.},
