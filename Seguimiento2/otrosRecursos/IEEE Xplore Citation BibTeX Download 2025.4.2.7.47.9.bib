  abstract={There is a perfect storm of the use of cloud computing, and the growth of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is about processing data that comes from devices in some way that's meaningful, and cloud computing is about leveraging data from centralized computing and storage. Growth rates of both can easily become unmanageable. We have some problems to solve. In addition, alternatives are being consider to placing everything in the public cloud because the public cloud, in some cases, no longer makes sense.},
