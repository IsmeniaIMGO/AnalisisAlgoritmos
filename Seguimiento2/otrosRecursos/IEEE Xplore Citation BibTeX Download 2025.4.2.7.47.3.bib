  abstract={In the present scenario, hybrid or multi-cloud environments are most suitable for Enterprises and Communities (like Government of India) for cloud bursting, disaster recovery, migration, and there is growing need for unified monitoring and management, however, it's challenging to setup a viable hybrid/multi-cloud environment. Currently, there are multiple solutions available in the market with limited success due to hidden drawbacks, for instance, vendor-lock-in, portability issues in migration, security threats and expensive in the long run and also, unfortunately, interoperability standardization is still work in progress. In this paper, we explore few hybrid/multi cloud use cases and demonstrate how these can be accomplished with our Federated Cloud Services Framework (middleware), which is built upon OpenStack [5], an open source cloud and by leveraging existing OpenStack functionalities.},
