  abstract={Today, with the progress of computer network technology, the advantages of artificial intelligence gradually began to show and become a new product under the development of the current era. At present, the strength of artificial intelligence technology lies in its data analysis and processing ability, because with the continuous development and progress of the society, the difficulty of processing data and information is becoming more and more complex for many years, and the processing ability of computers has begun to show shortcomings. The use of artificial intelligence can solve this problem well, and it can also put forward solutions according to the corresponding data problems, to timely deal with all kinds of data information. This paper mainly analyzes the application of artificial intelligence in computer network in the era of big data, and discusses the application and significance of artificial intelligence in big data.},
