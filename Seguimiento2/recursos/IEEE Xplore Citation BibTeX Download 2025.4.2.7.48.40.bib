  abstract={Although Virtual Machine placement has been extensively researched in traditional Cloud Computing environments, it remains an open challenging problem for Volunteer Cloud Computing, which exhibits several divergent characteristics, including intermittent availability of nodes and unreliable infrastructure. In this paper, we model the Virtual Machine placement problem in Volunteer Cloud Computing as a bounded 0-1 multi-dimensional knapsack problem and develop three heuristic based algorithms to meet the objectives and constraints specific to Volunteer Cloud Computing. Empirical evidences on a real Volunteer Cloud Computing test-bed show the competitive performance results of these algorithms.},
