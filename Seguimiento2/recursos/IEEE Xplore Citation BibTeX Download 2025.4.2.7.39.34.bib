  abstract={With the data and information is available at a tremendous rate, there is a need for machine learning approaches. Machine learning, it analyses the study and constructs the algorithms by making prediction on data. It builds model from the inputs to make the decisions or predictions. Machine learning algorithms it assists in bridging the gap of understanding. In this literature we investigate different machine learning approaches and its techniques.},
