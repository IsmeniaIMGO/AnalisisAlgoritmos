  abstract={SciCloud is a project studying the scope of establishing private clouds at universities. With these clouds, researchers can efficiently use the already existing resources in solving computationally intensive scientific, mathematical, and academic problems. The project established a Eucalyptus based private cloud and developed several customized images that can be used in solving problems from mobile web services, distributed computing and bio-informatics domains. The poster demonstrates the SciCloud and reveals two applications that are benefiting from the setup along with our research scope and results in scientific computing.},
