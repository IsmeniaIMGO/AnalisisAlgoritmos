  abstract={Modern ocean microbial research utilizes advanced molecular analytical techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA and protein probe arrays, and nucleic acid sequencing (etc.). Applying or at least initiating these techniques at the point and time of sample collection can enhance their effectiveness. To that end, in-situ sample processing and real-time molecular detection schemes have been implemented using deployable autonomous systems that can be operated in diverse ocean environments from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. Such devices have been termed “ecogenomic sensors.” The size of these instruments currently requires that they be moored in a fixed location or passively mobile, drifting at fixed depth and observing microbial communities in a moving frame of reference with ocean currents. With the highly dynamic motion of open water and microbial life, the next frontier of ocean microbial research requires the improved capability of an actively mobile asset. A mobile ecogenomic sensor encompasses a fully maneuverable vehicle with weeks of persistence, environmental data analysis, detection of physical and biological features, autonomous sampling and in situ analysis, and near-real-time data reporting. This system is now being developed by integrating three components: a compact molecular analytical instrument (the 3rd generation Environmental Sample Processor), a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle, and software algorithms for AUV-based feature detection and sampling. A summary of the system and its initial application is presented.},
