  abstract={Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of the software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to treatment of the role. The present study aims to analyse the situation to explore what restricts computer science and software engineering students from taking up a testing career in the software industry. To conduct this study, we surveyed 88 Pakistani students taking computer science or software engineering degrees. The results showed that the present study supports previous work into the unpopularity of testing compared to other software life cycle roles. Furthermore, the findings of our study showed that the role of tester has become a social role, with as many social connotations as technical implications.},
