  abstract={The classification of urban land cover is a crucial step in comprehending the evolution of the urban environment and its effects. We are providing a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for classifying urban land cover using remote sensing data in this research. The study utilises the Urban Land Cover dataset which is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains high-resolution images taken of urban areas. Also, comparison of several popular machine learning classification algorithms, such as Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM/SVC), XGBoost classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (KNN) and Ridge classifier is done along with their accuracy scores. This comparison shows that the Random Forest algorithm outperforms the other machine learning algorithms with an overall accuracy of 91.38 % after removing the outliers and using Grid Search CV to tune the hyper-parameters.},
