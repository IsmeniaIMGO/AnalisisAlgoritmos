  abstract={In the competition of modern marketing, it is highly important to foresee the correct personality profiles of customers because this may further improve the result of marketing campaigns. Therefore, in this research, three major models of machine learning are used, including Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Classifier, to discuss the challenges of predicting customer personalities. This study is helpful in finding unique customer segments and appropriate marketing strategies. These algorithms are valid to use for classifying customer personalities, and then determine the efficiency of it using the context also proves that through the more complex applications of such approaches, the efficacy of targeted marketing might be enhanced appropriately. Therefore, even more advanced deep learning techniques would be used at the next stage of research to further improve the forecasting accuracy and applicability in various marketing scenarios.},
