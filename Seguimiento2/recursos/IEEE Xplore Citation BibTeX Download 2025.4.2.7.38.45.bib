  abstract={The use of machine learning (ML) to recognize the stock market trend as well as companies, which are expected to provide the most profit with-in NIFTY50 index is a focus area work in the past 5 years of historical data. We use many ML models (linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) to predict stock price movements in order to decide which are the top 5 companies with the best return. In summary, according to our experiment the ML models can be good at predicting stock trends and are thus very useful for any investors. It demonstrates how deep learning and machine learning could be used to empower the levels of investment strategies with non-linear irregularities not captured by traditional models. The dictionary tells you what kind of processing has been performed on the data (such as missing value handling, normalization etc.), which keeps things more organized. We also use feature engineering techniques such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) to improve the predictability of these models.},
