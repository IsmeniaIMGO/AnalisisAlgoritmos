  abstract={Recently, many service providers or telecom operators are offering hybrid cloud services with edge computing to consumers, such as gaming, streaming, and manufacturing. However, the energy management of data centers is emphasized for enterprises in global ESG policy. Therefore, we propose the energy management architecture for hybrid cloud with edge computing which includes physical and virtual resources. In addition, we also propose the energy saving policy to improve resource utilization and cooling efficiency.},
